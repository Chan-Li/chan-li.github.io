## About me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the **Department of Physics** at the [**University of California, San Diego**](https://physics.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD), advised by [**Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld**](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/). I will advance to candidacy in December.  
My research lies at the intersection of **statistical physics and machine learning**, aiming to apply physics principles to understand the black box of deep learning and design physics-inspired learning algorithms.

I am currently working on:  
(1) applying statistical and physics-inspired modeling to analyze and optimize learning dynamics in neural networks,
(2) studying stability and non-equilibrium behavior to improve the robustness and efficiency of large-scale learning systems,
(3) uncovering universal scaling laws and phase-transition–like behaviors that govern model performance, and
(4) leveraging principles from statistical physics to develop interpretable, reliable, and scalable machine learning methods.

Before joining UC San Diego, I conducted research at [**Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) (Guangzhou, China) in the [PMI Lab](https://www.labxing.com/hphuang2018) under the supervision of [**Prof. Haiping Huang**](https://www.labxing.com/files/lab_data/368-1651116724-TsDPO0az.pdf).  
My earlier research focused on developing statistical-physics-based theories of learning, covering hierarchical credit assignment, emergent representations, continual learning, and predictive coding. These works collectively proposed a unified mean-field and ensemble framework for understanding how biological and artificial neural systems assign, transfer, and preserve information across multiple levels of representation.  

I received my **M.S. in Theoretical Physics** (2020–2023) and **B.S. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering** (2016–2020) from [**Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), Guangzhou, China.

My work has been published in *Physical Review Letters* (the top place in physics to announce rapidly novel exciting results), *Physical Review E*, and *Physical Review Research*.

> *I am currently exploring Summer 2026 research internship opportunities in machine learning and data science, aiming to apply my background in theoretical physics and statistical modeling to develop physics-inspired approaches for analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems.*
