## About me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the **Department of Physics** at the [**University of California, San Diego**](https://physics.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD), advised by [**Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld**](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/). I will advance to candidacy in December.  
My research lies at the intersection of **statistical physics and machine learning**, aiming to apply physics principles to understand the black box of deep learning and design physics-inspired learning algorithms.

I am currently working on:  
(1) dynamical mean-field theory of learning dynamics and double descent,  
(2) ergodicity breaking and fluctuation–dissipation theorem (FDT) violation in neural networks,  
(3) scaling laws and critical phenomena in overparameterized models, and  
(4) theoretical connections between statistical mechanics and generalization in deep learning.

Before joining UC San Diego, I conducted research at [**Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) (Guangzhou, China) in the [PMI Lab](https://www.labxing.com/hphuang2018) under the supervision of [**Prof. Haiping Huang**](https://www.labxing.com/files/lab_data/368-1651116724-TsDPO0az.pdf).  
My earlier research focused on developing statistical-physics-based theories of learning, covering hierarchical credit assignment, emergent representations, continual learning, and predictive coding. These works collectively proposed a unified mean-field and ensemble framework for understanding how biological and artificial neural systems assign, transfer, and preserve information across multiple levels of representation.  

I received my **M.S. in Theoretical Physics** (2020–2023) and **B.S. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering** (2016–2020) from [**Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), Guangzhou, China.

My work has been published in *Physical Review Letters* (the top place in physics to announce rapidly novel exciting results), *Physical Review E*, and *Physical Review Research*.

> *I am currently exploring Summer 2026 research internship opportunities in machine learning and data science, aiming to apply my background in theoretical physics and statistical modeling to develop physics-inspired approaches for analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems.*
