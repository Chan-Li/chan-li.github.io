Research experience
======
**[University of California, San Diego](https://physics.ucsd.edu/)** · *La Jolla, USA*  
*Graduate Researcher under [Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/)*  
*Sep 2023 – present*  
I study the statistical-physics foundations of generalization in modern machine learning.  
My current work develops a **dynamical mean-field theory** for the *double-descent transition* in neural networks,  
revealing how **ergodicity breaking** and **FDT violation** emerge during overparameterized learning.  
This project establishes a **scaling-theory description** of generalization as a critical phenomenon  
and has been **submitted for publication**.

**[Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)** · *Guangzhou, China*  
*Member of Researcher in PMI Lab; Advisor: [Prof. Haiping Huang](https://www.labxing.com/files/lab_data/368-1651116724-TsDPO0az.pdf)*  

- **Project 1. Learning credit assignment** *(Aug 2019 – Oct 2021)*  
  To explain hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a mean-field learning model.  
  The results have been published in *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **125, 178301 (2020)** and *Phys. Rev. E* **107, 024307 (2023)**.

- **Project 2. Emergence of hierarchical modes from deep learning** *(Aug 2021 – Oct 2022)*  
  We propose a mode decomposition learning that can interpret the weight matrices as a hierarchy of latent modes.  
  The results have been published in *Phys. Rev. Research* **5, L022011 (2023)**.

- **Project 3. Statistical mechanics of continual learning** *(Aug 2020 – Oct 2022)*  
  We propose a theory-grounded method for the real-world multi-task learning.  
  The results have been published in *Phys. Rev. E* **108, 014309 (2023)**.

- **Project 4. Meta predictive learning model of languages in neural circuits** *(Apr 2023 – Apr 2024)*  
  We propose a meta predictive coding framework for language tasks, to study the role of predictive coding and  
  the associated credit assignment in language processing.  
  The results have been published in *Phys. Rev. E* **109, 044309 (2024)**.
