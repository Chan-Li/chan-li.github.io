## Why I read this paper today

Continual learning always feels like a fundamental challenge between **plasticity** and **stability**:

- If the model keeps learning, it forgets (catastropic forgetting);
- If it remembers too well, it stops learning (catastropic remembering).

A straightforward way to prevent catastropic forgetting is to rigidly regularize the network so that its parameters remain close to their old values, but this solution creates an opposite failure mode: catastrophic remembering, where the model becomes too inflexible to learn new data at all. Together, these effects highlight a fundamental tension between stability and plasticity in continual learning: preventing forgetting through overly strong constraints can block adaptation, so effective methods must strike a balance rather than freezing the model.

## Biological Inspirations
Bayesian principles: biological synapses may operate according to Bayesian principles, maintaining an "error bar" on synaptic weight values to gauge uncertainty.

Meta-plasticity: Synapses adapt their plasticity based on the importance of prior tasks → widely regarded as a plausible mechanism that enables the brain to balance memory retention and flexibility.

## 💡 Core idea in one sentence

> **MESU introduces forgetting directly at the posterior level of a Bayesian neural network, so that uncertainty, plasticity, and memory emerge naturally from variational inference.**

---

## 🧠 Truncated posterior instead of infinite memory

Standard Bayesian continual learning accumulates evidence forever:

$$
p(\omega \mid D_1,\dots,D_t)
$$

MESU instead uses a **finite memory window**:
\[
p(\omega \mid D_{t-N},\dots,D_t)
\]

This single modeling choice already explains a lot:

- Old tasks fade smoothly rather than catastrophically
- The posterior variance does not collapse to zero
- Learning remains possible even after long training

In practice, past datasets are replaced by a *tempered posterior*, which leads to a closed-form **forgetting term** in the variational free energy.

---

## 🔄 Learning vs Forgetting in the free energy

The MESU objective decomposes cleanly into:
- **Learning**: fit the current dataset
- **Forgetting**: gently de-consolidate old synapses

The forgetting term explicitly encourages:
- pulling the mean back toward the prior
- increasing posterior variance to free capacity

This makes forgetting an *active, controlled process*, not a failure mode.

## 🧬 Metaplasticity emerges automatically

Each weight is modeled as a Gaussian:
\[
\omega_i \sim \mathcal N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)
\]

The update rule implies:
\[
\Delta \mu_i \propto \sigma_i^2 \, \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mu_i}
\]

So:

- Large epistemic uncertainty → fast learning
- Small epistemic uncertainty → slow learning

Plasticity is no longer a global hyperparameter — it is **learned per parameter**.

This is exactly what neuroscientists refer to as *metaplasticity*.

## 🧮 Connection to Hessian and EWC

One of my favorite aspects of the paper is the theoretical unification:

- Posterior variance scales inversely with the Hessian diagonal
- In the large-window limit, MESU recovers **EWC / Synaptic Intelligence**
- The update resembles a **diagonal Newton step** on the variational free energy

From a Bayesian perspective:
- EWC = Laplace approximation with frozen uncertainty
- MESU = Laplace approximation with *dynamic* uncertainty

This explains why EWC often over-consolidates parameters and loses flexibility.

---

## 🌍 Epistemic uncertainty and OOD behavior

Because MESU avoids variance collapse, it preserves epistemic uncertainty even after many tasks.

Empirically:
- In-distribution samples show low epistemic uncertainty
- OOD samples retain high uncertainty
- Deterministic methods fail by construction
- Bayesian methods without forgetting become over-confident

This reinforces a key message:

> **OOD detection requires not just Bayesian modeling, but controlled forgetting.**

---

## 🧠 Open questions I’m thinking about

Some directions that feel very natural to explore next:

- What happens beyond mean-field Gaussian posteriors?
- Can the memory window \(N\) be learned instead of fixed?
- Is there a clean DMFT / field-theoretic interpretation of variance dynamics?
- How does this connect to ergodicity breaking in learning dynamics?

It also feels closely related to ideas from:
- Online Laplace
- Broken ergodicity
- Critical slowing down near task saturation

---

## 🧭 Takeaway

This paper convinced me that:

> **Forgetting is not a bug in Bayesian learning — it is a missing term.**

Once forgetting is introduced at the posterior level, many problems in continual learning line up in a surprisingly clean way.

Definitely a paper I’ll return to.
