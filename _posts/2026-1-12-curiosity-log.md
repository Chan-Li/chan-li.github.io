## 🧩 Paper: *Multiscale emergence of directional traveling waves in random neuronal networks with nonreciprocal excitation–inhibition synaptic coupling*  
📄 [Phys. Rev. E (2025)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/jwrf-fk75)

### 1.1 Background  
The brain coordinates distributed neural activity through rich **spatiotemporal patterns**.  
Among these, **traveling waves (TWs)**—propagating oscillations of neural activity—have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for large-scale communication.  
A particularly compelling aspect of TWs is their **directionality**, which exhibits behaviorally relevant structure: waves often propagate from **parietal to anterior and posterior regions** during rest and memory tasks, yet can **reverse direction** across different behavioral contexts.

### 1.2 Questions  
Despite extensive experimental evidence, a **unified modeling framework** that seamlessly bridges the **neuronal**, **local circuit**, and **cortical network** scales remains elusive.

### 1.3 Key Idea  
The central idea is that **nonreciprocal excitation–inhibition (E–I) coupling**, even within isolated local many-body systems, **generically induces collective oscillations**.  
These local oscillatory dynamics can then organize into large-scale **directional traveling waves**.

### 1.4 Key Conclusions and Results  
The authors identify a **multi-pathway control mechanism** that provides a unified framework for explaining a wide range of experimentally observed wave dynamics, including:  
- **Fixed-direction propagation**, and  
- **Task-dependent wave reversal**.  

This mechanism naturally connects dynamics across multiple spatial scales.

### 1.5 Why It Is Interesting  
My advisor once raised the question: *“Is there any work showing that non-reciprocal neural networks can generate traveling wave structures?”*  
This paper provides a clear and concrete answer to that question.

### 1.6 Questions Worth Exploring  
There is a striking analogy between this system and **ecological models**, where **nonreciprocal coupling** also gives rise to traveling wave phenomena.  
Is there a deeper connection between these systems, and can this analogy be made more precise or even predictive?
