## 🧩 Paper: *Scaling laws and representation learning in simple hierarchical languages: Transformers versus convolutional architectures*  
📄 [Phys. Rev. E (2025)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/qtd6-nl8p)

### 1.1 Background  
Different neural network architectures are typically applied to different tasks, such as **transformers** for language modeling and **convolutional architectures** for computer vision.  
**Power laws** are among the most prominent empirical findings in modern deep learning: they appear remarkably consistent across domains and architectures and now serve as practical heuristics for guiding resource allocation in large-scale models.  
Their ubiquity suggests the existence of **fundamental statistical phenomena** underlying deep learning.  
If these phenomena are truly universal, they must reside in the **data itself**—although personally, I think they arise from the **interaction between neural networks and datasets**, not solely from deterministic statistical properties of the data.

### 1.2 Questions  
How do neural language models acquire a language’s structure when trained for **next-token prediction**?  
More specifically, how do **different architectures** learn **hierarchically compositional data**, and how do architectural differences affect the **scaling of performance**?

### 1.3 Key Idea  
The authors focus on **synthetic datasets** generated by the **random hierarchy model (RHM)**—an ensemble of hierarchically compositional generative processes corresponding to simple **context-free grammars (CFGs)**.  
In previous work, they developed a theory of **representation learning based on data correlations**, explaining how deep models capture hierarchical structure **sequentially, layer by layer**.  
Here, they extend this theoretical framework to explicitly account for **architectural differences**.

### 1.4 Key Conclusions and Results  
1. Deep networks infer the **hierarchical structure** of the data by exploiting **correlations between tokens**, and the authors derive the resulting **scaling of test error** with the number of training samples.

### 1.5 Why It Is Interesting  
This work introduces an **analytical model for language** together with a **theoretical method** to calculate scaling laws, offering a rare bridge between language modeling and statistical physics–style analysis.

### 1.6 Questions Worth Exploring  
- How many distinct theoretical approaches currently exist for **deriving scaling laws**?  
- How do the **statistical properties of the data** and the **learning dynamics** interact to drive the **evolution of representations**?
