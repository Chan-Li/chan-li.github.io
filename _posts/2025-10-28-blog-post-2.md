## 🧩 Paper 1: *Unveiling the Dimensionality of Networks of Networks*  
📄 [arXiv:2510.20520](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20520)

### 🔬 Background  
This paper presents a unifying view of **biological and artificial networks** as *composite systems* assembled from distinct functional units.  
A similar integrative logic underlies **brain evolution**, where conserved architectures (e.g., the basal ganglia) are reused to support increasingly complex cognitive functions.  
Understanding the **interplay between single-module structures and their combinations** in generating emergent collective behavior remains a central challenge across disciplines.

### 📘 Key Definitions  
**Definition 1 – Spectral Dimension:**  
Defined through the scaling of the Laplacian eigenvalue density. The spectral dimension governs asymptotic and thermodynamic behaviors on the network (e.g., return probability of random walks, relaxation times, critical phenomena) and behaves like a genuine geometric dimension.  
Typically, in the thermodynamic limit of infinite systems:
\[
\rho(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{d_s / 2 - 1}, \quad \lambda \to 0,
\]
where \( d_s \) is the spectral dimension.  
Another related measure is:
\[
D = \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i^2}.
\]

**Definition 2 – Fiedler Dimension:**  
At finite but large \( N \) (mesoscopic scales), additional structural indicators appear.  
The smallest non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue (the *Fiedler eigenvalue*) governs relaxation, diffusion, and synchronization robustness.  
The Fiedler dimension describes how this eigenvalue approaches zero as \( N \) increases.  
In homogeneous networks, Fiedler and spectral dimensions coincide.

**Definition 3 – Bundled Networks:**  
A relevant class of *inhomogeneous composite structures* formed by superpositions of translationally invariant lattices.  
They exhibit anomalous diffusion and serve as analytically tractable examples of *networks of networks*.  
While their spectral dimensions are known, their mesoscopic Fiedler scaling remains poorly characterized.

---

### 💡 Key Idea  
Using the **Laplacian Renormalization Group (LRG)**, the authors show that in *composite networks*, the **Fiedler dimension decouples from the spectral dimension**.  
They introduce a general RG framework to determine the emergent Fiedler dimension in bundled networks, deriving analytical expressions for both spectral and Fiedler dimensions in a broad class of modular systems.

---

### 🌱 Why It’s Interesting  
Some neural networks can be regarded as *networks of networks*.  
This paper provides a way to use **renormalization group techniques** to study their emergent geometry and collective behavior — potentially offering new insights into how RG ideas apply to deep or modular architectures.

---

### ❓ Open Questions / Worth Exploring  
1. What is the **physical or functional significance** of the difference between Fiedler and spectral dimensions?  
   Could this framework generalize to more complex or asymmetric networks?  
2. Could one classify **universality classes** based on these dimensions — perhaps analogous to how double descent transitions organize learning dynamics in my current research?

---

## 🧩 Paper 2: *Prediction of Neural Activity in Connectome-Constrained Recurrent Networks*  
📄 [Nature Neuroscience (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02080-4)

### 🔬 Background  
A major goal in theoretical neuroscience is to link the **connectivity of large neural networks** with their emergent dynamics.  
Traditionally, the *inverse problem* seeks to infer connectivity from observed activity, but this is difficult due to parameter degeneracy.  
Recently, comprehensive **synaptic connectome datasets** have enabled researchers to approach the *forward problem* — predicting neural dynamics given connectivity, despite uncertainty in biophysical parameters.

---

### 💡 Key Idea  
The authors train a **teacher** and **student** network sharing the *same synaptic matrix* but differing in *single-neuron parameters* (e.g., nonlinear activation parameters reflecting biophysical heterogeneity).  
Both perform the same task, and the authors measure:
- the **similarity** of teacher and student neural activity, and  
- the **similarity** of their single-neuron parameters.

---

### 📘 Conclusions  
- Multiple sets of single-neuron parameters can produce distinct activity patterns that solve the *same task*.  
- When connectivity constraints are combined with partial neural recordings, this degeneracy is reduced.  
- Even with accurate activity reconstruction, neuron-level parameters are not fully recovered — implying some parameters are **“stiff”** (strongly affect dynamics) while others are **“sloppy”** (weakly affect dynamics).

---

### 🌱 Why It’s Interesting  
This introduces a novel **teacher–student paradigm** emphasizing connectivity constraints rather than weight values.  
It suggests that identical connectivity can yield drastically different dynamics — a profound insight for understanding **degeneracy and functional equivalence** in learning systems.

---

### ❓ Open Questions / Worth Exploring  
1. If identical connectivities can produce very different dynamics, could the **distribution of connectivity** serve as a performance measure?  
   What common features exist among well-generalizing networks?  
2. Could **gating behaviors** create multiple functional solutions even with random connectivity — and might a unifying theory describe this degeneracy?  
3. What is the **minimal model** capable of performing a task?  
   Is degeneracy itself a *functional* property that supports flexibility in learning?

---

### 🧠 Reflection  
Both papers touch on **degeneracy and emergent structure** — whether in modular composite networks or connectome-constrained neural systems.  
They invite a deeper question: *When do multiple microscopic realizations yield equivalent macroscopic behavior — and when do they diverge?*  
Perhaps the answer lies at the intersection of **spectral geometry** and **learning dynamics**, where RG, topology, and generalization all converge.
