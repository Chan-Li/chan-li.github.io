## 🧩 Paper 1 (Worth Reading in Detail): *Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation*  
📄 [arXiv:2510.24616 (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24616)  

### 1.1 Background  
Until now, quantitative theories of neural networks that predict which features they can extract, how much data \(n\) they require, and how well they generalize have often relied on **over-simplified assumptions** about architecture or data abundance.  

### 1.2 Questions  
This limitation prevented precise characterization of how **depth** and **nonlinearity** jointly influence learning when networks are trained with enough data to fully express their representational power.  

Main questions the paper addresses:  
- **Q1:** Assuming training data are generated by a target MLP, how much data are needed to reach a given generalization performance using a Bayes-optimal MLP with the same architecture?  
- **Q2:** Given a fixed data budget, which target features can the MLP learn?  
- **Q3:** Given finite compute and data, can practical algorithms reach the Bayes-optimal solution, or are they limited by **statistical–computational gaps**?  

### 1.3 Key Idea  
The authors use the **replica method** to study supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron in the **Bayesian optimal teacher–student** framework, under two key conditions:  
1. Network width scales with input dimension — promoting feature learning while avoiding the degeneracy of ultra-wide networks.  
2. The system lies in the **interpolation regime**, where data size and parameter count are comparable, forcing the model to adapt precisely to the task.  

### 1.4 Key Conclusions & Results  
- A **rich phenomenology** of learning transitions emerges.  
- With sufficient data, optimal performance is achieved via **specialization** toward the target — yet training algorithms may get trapped in **sub-optimal states** predicted by theory.  
- Specialization proceeds **inhomogeneously** across layers (from shallow to deep) and across neurons within each layer.  
- **Deeper targets** are systematically harder to learn.  

### 1.5 Why It Is Interesting  
This is the **first statistical-physics analysis** of deep MLPs via replicas — technically impressive though analytically intricate.  
While the final results are algebraically heavy, the conceptual progress is substantial.  
I should study their derivation carefully and explore how similar analyses could be applied to other questions in learning theory.

### 1.6 Questions Worth Exploring  
- Can the derivations be **simplified using renormalization-group (RG)** ideas?  
- How do the learning transitions correspond to **phase transitions** in the order-parameter landscape?  
- Could one define a “critical surface” separating efficient and inefficient learning regimes?

## 🧠 Paper 2: *Bayesian continual learning and forgetting in neural networks*  

### 2.1 Background  
A long-standing challenge in artificial networks is **catastrophic forgetting** — the tendency to lose previously learned information when new tasks are introduced.  
Biological synapses, in contrast, maintain a remarkable balance between **stability** and **plasticity**, retaining memories while remaining adaptable.

### 2.2 Question  
Why can the brain manage this equilibrium effortlessly, while AI models struggle?  

### 2.3 Key Idea  
The paper advances the hypothesis that biological synapses operate under **Bayesian principles**, maintaining **uncertainty estimates (error bars)** over synaptic weights.  
They propose **Metaplasticity from Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU)** — a continual-learning method inspired by this idea, where *metaplasticity* allows synapses to flexibly adjust while preserving long-term information.  

### 2.4 Key Conclusions & Results  
- Across image-classification benchmarks, **MESU mitigates forgetting** while maintaining adaptability.  
- On task-incremental **CIFAR-100**, MESU consistently outperforms standard training methods.  
- The **boundary-free streaming formulation** enables efficient continual updates without catastrophic interference.  

### 2.5 Why It Is Interesting  
This approach resonates closely with my earlier work on **variational continual learning**  
([Phys. Rev. E 108, 014309 (2023)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.014309)).  
I’m curious to see exactly how their formulation extends or refines that probabilistic framework.

### 2.6 Questions Worth Exploring  
- How does MESU’s Bayesian update connect to **non-equilibrium learning dynamics**?  
- Could a **probability-distribution-level training protocol** (as in our future work) generalize this idea?  
- Are there analogies between **synaptic uncertainty** and **fluctuation–dissipation mechanisms** in physics-based learning?

🧩 *Overall reflection:* both papers highlight how **probabilistic and statistical-physics perspectives** are converging to explain deep learning — from **phase transitions in MLPs** to **Bayesian plasticity in continual learning.**
