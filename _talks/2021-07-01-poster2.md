## Poster Description

This poster presents a **mean-field theoretical framework for understanding hierarchical credit assignment in deep learning**. While modern deep networks achieve remarkable predictive power, their nested nonlinear structure obscures how learning coordinates millions of parameters to reach a decision.  

To address this, we propose a **mean-field learning model** in which an **ensemble of sub-networks**, rather than a single network, is trained for classification. The analysis reveals that synaptic connections naturally divide into three functional categories:  
1. **Essential connections** critical for decision making,  
2. **Irrelevant connections** that can be pruned without performance loss, and  
3. **Variable connections** that capture nuisance factors and encode task variability.  

This framework provides a **statistical–physics perspective** on the emergence of structure and redundancy in deep learning, offering insights into how complex networks perform distributed credit assignment and maintain generalization.
