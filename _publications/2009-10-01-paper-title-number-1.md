excerpt: 'Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction accuracies in a variety of scientific and industrial
domains. However, the nested non-linear feature of deep learning makes the learning highly nontransparent, i.e., it is still unknown how the learning coordinates a huge number of parameters to
achieve a decision making. To explain this hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a mean-field
learning model by assuming that an ensemble of sub-networks, rather than a single network, are
trained for a classification task. Surprisingly, our model reveals that apart from some deterministic
synaptic weights connecting two neurons at neighboring layers, there exist a large number of connections that can be absent, and other connections can allow for a broad distribution of their weight
values. Therefore, synaptic connections can be classified into three categories: very important ones,
unimportant ones, and those of variability that may partially encode nuisance factors. Therefore,
our model learns the credit assignment leading to the decision, and predicts an ensemble of subnetworks that can accomplish the same task, thereby providing insights toward understanding the
macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens of distinct roles of synaptic weights.'
